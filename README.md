# Williwaw - Programmer Task
 
## Summary 
We are providing you with a simple Unity project comprising several basic scenes, scripts, models, prefabs, and resources.
Your task is to implement as many of the following functionalities as possible.
The final result should be a functional and buildable Unity project.

An initial project structure and a few scripts have been provided; it is recommended that you use these as guidelines for structuring your project and writing your code.
Most of the code you happen to write should reside in the Williwaw.Gameplay folder, however, if you need to, you are free to restructure the project as you see fit. 
Note, certain parts of this task description are purposefully vague, to allow us to better get to know your approach and thought process. 

### Scenes
The game should start at the Main Menu scene, which should have the options to either start or quit the game. 
Starting the game should load the Game and Terrain scenes and quitting the game should quit the application.
The Main Menu scene is completely empty, so it's up to you to create the necessary UI for it.
During gameplay, the player should have the ability to pause, return to the Main Menu scene, or exit the application.

### Character
We are also providing you with a character model, three animations and some textures.
Clicking on the terrain should move the character to the selected location while playing the correct animation.

### Interactions
We're giving you a desk model and its textures.
You'll need to create a basic system so players can interact with objects in the scene.
When interacting with an object, a menu should pop up showing available actions.

### Ingredients & Recipes
Interacting with the Desk should display a menu with the options to *Create* a new recipe, *View* all recipes or *Close* the context menu.

Clicking on *Create* should open a Create Recipe UI window and allow the player to create a new recipe.
Creating a recipe is the simple process of selecting ingredients and giving a name for the recipe.
There's an "Interaction" animation that should be played upon creating a new recipe.

Clicking on *View* should display all newly created recipes as well as all existing ones.
 
### Editor
Create a simple editor window that would list all ingredient assets with the ability to edit their properties.

### Prefabs, Scripts and Resources
In the project, you'll find a few simple scripts, prefabs, and various resources already available.
While their usage isn't mandatory, they serve primarily as a style guide.
Feel free to modify them according to your preferences, as they can offer a useful starting point for your work.

## Submission
Once you are done with this task, create a repository with the project and share it with us
(philip@williwawgames.com, hamid@williwawgames.com, simona@williwawgames.com), then email us letting us know that youâ€™ve finished it. 
Create a short video showing you starting the game at the Main Menu scene, loading into the game, and demonstrating the different interactions you've worked on. 
Include the video and how long the task took you in the email, and optionally feel free to share any feedback you may have about it.
Any other additional work you do that adds functionality would be considered a bonus.
Good luck!
